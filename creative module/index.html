                Music is an art that reflects the emotions of human real life (English name: music; French name:
                musique; Italian: musica). Music can be divided into two major types of vocal music and instrumental
                music, and can be roughly divided into classical music, folk music, original ecological music, modern
                music (including popular music) and so on. In the art type, music is a relatively abstract art, and
                music can be divided into oriental music and western music from the historical development. The ancient
                Chinese theoretical foundation headed by Chinese Han music is the pentatonic scale, namely the palace,
                the merchant, the horn, the levy, the feather, and the west is dominated by the seven-tone scale. The
                music is pleasing to the eye and brings you a sense of hearing. Music can improve people's aesthetic
                ability, purify people's minds, and establish lofty ideals. We express our emotions through music and
                release many of our emotions. </p>
